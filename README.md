# Virtual_Paint_CV

Welcome to the Virtual Paint! 🎨✨

You can draw with your index finger of both of your hands. 👆

If you hold both your index and middle finger up, then you'll stop drawing.

Choose colors: 🟦 Blue, 🔴 Red, 🟩 Green by hovering on the brushes in the header.

To erase, just hover on the eraser. 🧽

To clean the screen, press 'c' on your keyboard.

To adjust brush/eraser thickness, press '+' or '-' on your keyboard.

To create a custom color, press 9 number keys on your keyboard, and see the numbers you pressed in the terminal.

Each 3 key you pressed will represent one channel in BGR.

If you want one channel to have a two or one-digit number just press 0. 🤓

For example to have the color (75, 7, 200) press 075007200.

To quit drawing, press 'q' on your keyboard.

That's all for now, happy drawing! 🤩🎉
